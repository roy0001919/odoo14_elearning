----------------------------------------------------------------------
    * CODA v1 support.
    * CODA v2.2 support.
    * Foreign Currency support.
    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).

      Communications.
    * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.
    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single

The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records).

Remark on CODA V1 support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
V2.2 specifications.
If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.
